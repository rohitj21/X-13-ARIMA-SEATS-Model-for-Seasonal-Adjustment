C     component filters common block
C
C     filters: column 1 = symmetric, column 2 = concurrent
C       size of filters is the same as size of data.
      DOUBLE PRECISION treFlt(1200,2), SAFlt(1200,2)
C     cycles/period set - all 1200 entries used.
      DOUBLE PRECISION fltW(0:1200)
C     for each filter: squared-gain, time-shift = - phase-delays;
C       all 1200 entries used.

C     concurrent filter zero (at some frequency): 1 for SA, 2 for trend

C     Does each quantity exist. for each filter, squared-gain, phase-delays
